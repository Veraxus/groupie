Groups, Membership, and Private Content for WordPress

== Description ==

**This plugin is the successor to "Page Security by Contexture"**

Take control of your website. This plugin provides simple, intuitive control over what areas of your site users are allowed to access.

Easily create user groups, memberships (with or without expiration dates), and then choose which pages or sections each group is allowed to access.

Best of all, this plugin is easy to use. It integrates seamlessly with WordPress and it *just works*.

== Installation ==

= Via WordPress Admin =

1. From your sites admin, go to Plugins > Add New
1. In the search box, type 'XXXXXX' and press enter
1. Locate the entry for 'XXXXXX' (there should be only one) and click the 'Install' link
1. When installation is finished, click the 'Activate' link

= Manual Install =

1. Upload `XXX-XXX-XXX` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. You're finished! Start using XXXXXX.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= This is missing some of Page Securities features! =
That's not a question. But keep in mind that this is a *completely new* project, not an upgraded version of Page Security. We started from scratch so that this version would be much easier to maintain, upgrade, and improve.

= Can I import settings from Page Security? =
Sorry, but not right now. This is on our wish list, too, but the underlying technology is very, very different from Page Security, so we can't make any promises right now.
